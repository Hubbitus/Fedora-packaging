* Fri Oct 16 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.7.5-1
  Fix a segfault on free after unmounting lessfs without
  encryption support. Fix a problem that could lead to a
  deadlock when using file_io with NFS.
  A performance improvement, changed a mutex lock for a
  spinlock.
* Sun Oct 11 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.7.4
  This version of lessfs introduces a new hash named
  Blue Midnight Whish : http://www.q2s.ntnu.no/sha3_nist_competition/start
  This is a very fast hash that increases lessfs performance
  significantly. The implementation makes it easy to use any
  of the hashes from the NIST hash competition. MBW was 
  choosen for lessfs because of the speed.
  To use BMW : configure --with-sha3
* Tue Oct 06 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.7.2
  Fix a typo in lib_tc.c that can lead to data corruption.
* Mon Oct 05 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.7.1
  Introduced a new data storage backend, file-io.
  Higher overall performance.
* Sun Sep 06 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.6.1
  Never improve your code minutes before releasing it.
  Fix a silly bug with mklessfs.
* Sun Sep 06 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.6.0
  Added encryption support to lessfs.
  Fixed one small bug that would leave orphaned meta data in the
  metadatabase when hardlinks where removed.
* Wed Aug 26 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.5.0
  Improved thread locking that leads to much better performance.
  Many NFS related problems have been solved and debugging
  is now easier.
* Mon Aug 17 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.2.8
  Many bugfixes, including incorrect filesize on writing
  in a file with various offsets using lseek. This also
  caused problems with NFS.
* Fri Aug 14 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.2.7
  Fixed a problem where dbstat failed to return the proper
  filesize. One other bug could leak to a deadlock of lessfs.
* Fri Jul 17 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.2.6
  Fixed two bugs, one which could lead to data corruption.
  One other that would leave deleted data in the database.
* Wed Jul 08 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.2.5
  This release fixes to one minor and one major bug.
  One bug in the code would actually crash lessfs
  upon renaming a file or directory. lessfs-0.2.4
  is no longer available for download.
* Sun Jul 05 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.2.4
  Added support for automatic defragmentation.
* Tue Jun 23 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.2.3
  This release fixes a small memory leak and improves
  write performance in general approx 12%.
  Known issues : 
  Using direct_io with kernel 2.6.30 causes reads to
  continue for ever. I am not sure if this is a kernel
  issue or a lessfs bug. With earlier kernels direct_io
  works fine.
* Sun Jun 21 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.2.2
  NFS support and improved caching code.
  WARNING : nfs will only work with kernel >= 2.6.30
* Wed Jun 10 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.2.1
  Improved the performance of writes smaller then 
  max_write in size. These writes will now remain long
  enough in the cache so that subsequent writes to the 
  same block will update the cache instead of the database.
  Mounting lessfs without formatting the filesystem now
  logs a warning instead of creating a segfault.
  Creating of sparse files now works again after being 
  broken in release 0.1.19.
* Mon May 25 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.2.0
  Added a cache that improves performance with approx 30%.
* Thu May 14 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.1.22
  Fixed a data corruption bug (workaround) when the 
  underlying filesystems run out of space. Fixed a problem
  with hardlinking symlinks.
* Wed Apr 22 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.1.20
  Fixed two bugs:
  1. Truncate operations would sometimes fail.
  2. unlink of hardlinked files would sometimes fail.
* Wed Apr 04 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.1.19 
  Fixed a bug in the truncation routine where a delete chunk 
  would remain in the database. Cleaned up the init script.
* Mon Mar 30 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.1.18 
* Mon Mar 27 2009 Mark Ruijter <mruijter@lessfs.com> - 0.1.17
